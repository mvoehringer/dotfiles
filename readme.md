## Install Homebrew formulae ##
When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common Homebrew formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

    brew bundle bundle/Brewfile

## Install cask ##

    brew install phinze/cask/brew-cask
    brew tap caskroom/versions

    $ brew bundle bundle/Caskfile
